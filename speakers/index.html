      <p>
          GopherCon UK is focused on education and discussion of the Go programming language. We aim to attract the best speakers, contributors, and educators from around the world in hopes of providing the community with the best resources on the Go programming language every year.
          <br><br>We are looking for speakers and instructors to give talks and hands-on classroom sessions. We are seeking talks covering mainstream, advanced, niche or non-technical topics aimed at a multitude of skill levels.
          <br><br>GopherCon UK seeks to deliver ‘wow’ talks that are fresh and inspiring about cutting edge topics or new perspectives on common problems. The audience will be from all backgrounds varying in skill level from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so talks varying widely in topic and skill levels are required. Most of all we want speakers who have a deep knowledge about the topics they are proposing and can’t wait to share that knowledge with a whole group of of eager listeners. Tell us what you’re most passionate about and why we should be passionate about it as well.
