    	<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Golang UK is a conference centered around education and discussion of Go programming language related topics. We aim to attract the best speakers, contributors, and educators from around the world in the hopes of providing the community with the best resource on the Go language every year.</p>

		<p>We are looking for speakers and instructors to give talks and hands-on classroom sessions relating to the Go programming language. We are seeking talks covering mainstream, advanced, niche or non-technical areas and instruction sessions aimed at a multitude of skill levels.</p>
        
		<p>Golang UK seeks to deliver 'wow' talks that are fresh and inspiring about cutting edge topics or new perspectives on common problems. The audience will be from all backgrounds varying in skill level from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so talks varying widely in topic and skill levels are required. Most of all we want speakers who have a deep knowledge about the topics they are proposing and can't wait to share that knowledge with a whole group of of eager listeners. Tell us what you're most passionate about and why we should be passionate about it as well.</p>
        
		<h2>Selection Process</h2>
		<p>We receive on average 100 abstract submissions for 30 speaking slots. We're going to select 30 talks (2 trainings, 4 keynotes, 8 tutorials, 16 sessions), following 3 step process: </p>

		<ol>
			<li>Using an anonymised list of all papers (contains talk title, abstract, and 'why you should choose this talk'), the organisers rate each talk from 1-5 to create a shortlist of around 60 abstracts.</li>
			<li>Abstracts are then discussed and put in order of must have talks, with the top 30-40 papers being the focus.</li>
			<li>Submissions are then deanonymised and final selections are made based on the speaker's location/cost of travel and level of the talk.</li>
		</ol>
        
        <p>Please select from the following options when submitting your call for papers: training (half day or full day), keynote (30 mins), tutorial (60 mins), or session (30 mins).</p>

		<h3>Package</h3>
		<p>What's in it for me? Fame and fortune! Well, maybe not just yet, but, speaking at a conference is a great way to give back to the amazing Go community that has given so much to you.
