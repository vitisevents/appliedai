            <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
            <p>The material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class. Students with the following minimal background will get the most out of the class.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A working knowledge of a modern programming language (Java, Ruby, Python, C, C++, C#, Perl, etc.)</li>
                <li>A basic understanding of operating system concepts and environment variables</li>
                <li>Experience working with a command shell and navigating a filesystem</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Course overview</h4>
            <p>Go is a modern programming language with a heavy focus on developer productivity, scalability, and speed. Whether you're a recent grad or an industry veteran, there's no better time to learn the core concepts of the Go programming language. This course introduces language fundamentals, such as primitives, language structure, design, and concurrency. If you have little or no experience with Go and want to jumpstart your knowledge, this course is for you.</p>
            <h4>This course is for you because:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You want to review the Go language to see if it's something that will work for you and your teamâ€™s next project.</li>
                <li>You currently develop in another language and are interested in learning how Go handles similar constructs and how it's different.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Course outline</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>Welcome</h5>
                    <p>Welcome to class. Let's do some introductions and get started!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Getting Started With Go</h5>
                    <p>This course will walk you through installing Go, setting up your GOPATH, and adding GOBIN to your path. It will also test to ensure the installation and environment is properly set up. Finally, it will discuss several options for code editors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Syntax And Types</h5>
                    <p>In this course we will cover the basic keywords and syntax of the Go language. You'll learn the keywords, operators, and delimiters that make up the language. You'll them move into Syntax and Types. Learn how strings are handled as well as UTF-8 text. You'll also learn about variables, constants, and iota. Then, using those concepts, how to create structs and initialize them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Arrays And Iteration</h5>
                    <p>Arrays in Go are useful when planning for detailed layout of memory. Using arrays can sometimes help avoid allocation. However, their primary use is for the building blocks of slices. This module will cover the basics of creating, initializing, and indexing an array. It will also cover basic loop constructs and loop control basics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Slices</h5>
                    <p>Slices wrap arrays in Go, and provide a more general, powerful, and convenient interface to data sequences. In this module, you will cover slice basics such as creating, initializing, and iteration. You will also learn how to grow a slice, work with subsets of slices, and slice tricks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Maps</h5>
                    <p>Maps are a powerful built-in data structure that associates keys and values. In this module you will cover basic map creation, initialization, and iteration. You will discover how to determine if values exist in maps and how to update and delete map values.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h5>Pointers</h5>
                <p>A pointer is a type that holds the address that points to a variables value. In many languages, pointers are the source of pain and confusion. Go has made it easy to use and understand pointers. In this module you will learn about the difference between pass by value and pass by reference. You will learn hot to declare pointers, and how to reference values as pointers. The module will discuss performance and security and when to use pointers as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Interfaces</h5>
                    <p>Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object: if something can do this, then it can be used here. This module will take a look at how to use interfaces to abstract that behavior. Concepts such as the Empty Interface, satisfying multiple interfaces, and asserting for behavior will be covered. Additionally this module will cover the difference between value and pointer receivers and how they affect the ability to satisfy an interface.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Errors</h5>
                    <p>Error handling in Go can feel a bit tedious at first. However, this module will cover the benefits of how Go's error model results in more reliable code. This module will cover how to handle basic errors, return errors as an interface that satisfies the error type. Concepts such as custom error types, panics, recovering from panics, and sentinel errors are also covered.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Concurrency</h5>
                    <p>Concurrent programming in many environments is made difficult by the subtleties required to implement correct access to shared variables. Go encourages a different approach in which shared values are passed around on channels and, in fact, never actively shared by separate threads of execution. This module covers Go routines and how to synchronize communication between them. Mechanics for synchronization such as WaitGroups, Mutexs, and Channels are explored along with the corresponding patterns for each. Find out the difference between a buffered and unbuffered channel, and when to use them. Also discover how to use channels for signaling for concepts such as graceful application shutdown.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Finalize</h5>
                    <p>This module covers where to get more support on Go, recommends books and videos, and list contact information for your instructor.</p>

                <li>You want to use the built in tools to profile and measure performance of your software.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Course Outline</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>Concurrency</h5>
                    <p>Concurrent programming in many environments is made difficult by the subtleties required to implement correct access to shared variables. Go encourages a different approach in which shared values are passed around on channels and, in fact, never actively shared by separate threads of execution.This module covers Go routines and how to synchronize communication between them.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Testing</h5>
                    <p>Go ships with a powerful testing framework. Tests in Go are written in the Go language, so there is no need to learn another syntax. This module will explore basic tests, table driven tests, and sub-tests. Concepts such as race conditions, code coverage, test automation. Understanding test options such as parallel, short testing, timing out tests, and verbose are also covered.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Benchmarking</h5>
                    <p>Go comes with a powerful set of tools for profiling and improving the performance of your code. Benchmarking is one of those tools, and the first one most developers start with. In this module we will cover basic benchmarking, some common benchmarking mistakes, and how to compare benchmarks to see if performance has improved.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Profiling</h5>
                    <p>Go ships with a number of profiling tools. This chapter will walk you through how to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use interactive pprof with a cpu profile</li>
                        <li>Use interactive pprof with different types of memory profiles</li>
                        <li>Generate profiles from benchmarks</li>
                        <li>Generate profiles from live/running applications</li>
                        <li>Generate torch graphs from benchmarks or live/running applications</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Delve</h5>
                    <p>Delve is a source level debugger for Go. In this module, we will learn how to launch Delve and interactively debug a program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Building And Compiling Go Applications</h5>
                    <p>Go has the ability to build and cross compile with ease. This chapter will cover the different ways to build your binary and additionally covers concepts for embedding build information such as version and GitHub SHA-1 hash. See how build tags are used to conditionally include specific branches of code by targeting specific platforms or simply using the tags provided.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Finalize</h5>
                    <p>This module covers where to get more support on Go, recommends books and videos, and list contact information for your instructor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>If time permits, we will also cover</h4>
                <li>
                    <h5>Testing Asynchronous Tasks</h5>
                    <p>Many times you may be testing parts of your code that have service     dependency that run for an unknown amount of time. Examples of these may be task queues, distributed system calls, etc. Because you don't know how long they may take to execute, testing them can present some challenges. In this module we will learn how to set up tests both effectively and efficiently for testing async processes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Mocking Tests</h5>
                    <p>It's easy to decouple packages in Go using interfaces. Because of this, testing can also be much easier. However, you typically want to mock out your interfaces in tests so that unit testing is much easier. This chapter will cover how to write a mock for a service to enable easy and precise testing.</p>

            <h3>Using and extending the Kubernetes API programmatically</h3>
            <h4>Instructors: Stefan Schimanski &amp; Michael Hausenblas</h4>
            <p>Kubernetes is the de-fact industry standard for container orchestration. In this workshop youâ€™ll learn how to program Kubernetes using Go. We will start with the basic concepts (pods, namespace, labels, workloads, nodes, events, etc.) and provide step by step guidance how to implement a variety of tasks against the Kubernetes API with the Go programming languages. The two main Go libraries used in this workshop will be https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go as well as https://github.com/openshift/client-go in addition to the Go standard library. For each participant access to a Kubernetes cluster will be provided, and it is beneficial if you have the latest Go version installed on your laptop in order to follow along. We will provide a GitHub repo with all code samples used in the workshop.</p>
