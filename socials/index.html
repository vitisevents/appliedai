	    <h1>Socials</h1>
	    <p>An important part of any conference is being able to network with other delegates and Golang UK is no exception. We've arranged two social events - before and after the conference.</p>

	        <h2>Thursday</h2>
	        <h3>August 20</h3>
	        <p>Thursday night we’ll be kicking off the main conference on Friday with a pre-conference night social at the pub. Anyone is welcome to come, whether you’re attending the conference or just the tutorial day. We'll be meeting at the Fox pub on Paul Street from 6pm til close for drinks, snacks, and a chance to meet other delegates before the conference starts. Look for our conference volunteers wearing a conference t-shirt to find the group.</p>
