I currently work as a consultant at <a href="https://www.miles.in">Miles</a>. Before becoming a consultant I have previously worked as a researcher within the field of human computer interaction in the process industry with a focus on process automation and robotics. I have a broad educational background with a master's degree in Electrical Engineer, a master's degree in Behavioral Science and I am currently finishing a master's degree in Emotion Psychology. During my psychology studies I came across the field of affective computing which combines psychology with computer science. Taking into account the focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning of today I believe it is important to take the human factor into account and try to make our systems adapt to the way we function as humans.

Thus, his primary concern changed: how to bridge the gap between ML and production? :-) DataOps FTW! He is an active part of the community (devopsdays Amsterdam, ITNEXT, amsterdam.ai & Codemotion), a knowledge-sharer, a proud father and a Big DataOps & AI Lead. Thiago is pathologically curious and a continuous learner. He knows that high-performing data teams must decrease time-to-market and build production-ready applications, always!"

            description: "AI is such a buzzword, with its futuristic implementations and sophisticated machine learning algorithms (Hello, Deep learning!). We are using ML when we need external data to reach a working product because it would be impossible to solve it with the regular for/if/loops. What are the next steps? Moreover, what about Test, Release, and Deployment? We always value data and call our organizations “data-driven”, but now the impact is even bigger. If you are using an ML component, misused/dirty/problematic data will affect not your internal reports as before… but your application deployment and quality of service. Let’s discuss some AI implementations stories (its advantages/problems) finding common mistakes and future challenges for such a hyped theme to end the session with a live demo (if the gods allow it!)!"

            # bio: Back in 1987 I graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in Physics, it was only natural therefore that I moved onto investment banking! I then embarked on a journey that saw me directing and shaping some of the leading companies in the tech world. These included setting up the Polish telecoms practice for Accenture, serving on the EMEA Executive Council for Infosys, and leading Wipro’s global Public Sector business. I also held senior roles at digital agencies, including Scient and Razorfish, and in 2007 the UK Government appointed me as advisor on global technology industries. My passion is not only in bringing about technological change for the sake of it, but in transgressing existing boundaries and adding genuine, sustainable value.

            # description: We worked on developing a smart tracker that accurately predicts women’s menstrual cycles, ovulation and fertile days. Using an abundance of data that was previously not being harnessed, we pursued the challenge of developing an application that didn’t just give women an “average likelihood” but actually forecasted the specific days of their cycles. The Neural Network we built took advantage of new and old data inputs, to give each person a prediction unique to them, and used unsupervised learning to continuously adapt its forecasts. With this we observed tremendous results, both from a technical and human perspective, and we encountered a number of surprises along the way that made the final result all the more better.

What you might not know is that Google were in the audience watching, and came to IBM afterwards with a proposition. From there, the OpenPOWER Foundation was formed, which started as a partnership between IBM, Google, NVIDIA, Mellanox and Tyan and now has over 330 members. Want to know what Google have done since then? Come along and I'll tell you! But, what has this got to do with my daughter, Elizabeth and her love of dogs? Using some of the solution components that have come from the OpenPOWER Foundation, she was able to expand on an existing Machine Learning model and teach an IBM Power System to identify a Dachshund. She is not a Data Scientist (at least not yet), so how did she do that? Come and find out!
