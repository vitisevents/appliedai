      about: 
        "We're a supplier of home services (Energy, Telephony, Insurance & Broadband) with around 2% of the UK market, a unique business model and a huge potential to grow.
        <br><br>
        As an established, 20-year-old British company our challenges are to rebuild whilst continuing to innovate and compete, in order to develop a platform to enable the future growth of the business. We have secured the relevant investment to rebuild in house.
        <br><br>
        We truly are unique in our proposition and allow our customers to consolidate payments into a single monthly bill by packaging products and services supplied through a network of wholesale partners. Utility Warehouse is the only genuine multi-utility operator in the market providing products and services to households and businesses nationwide.
        <br><br>
        At the beginning of 2016 we started a fundamental transformation here at Utility Warehouse - driven by the Board, there’s a strong desire to become a modern, agile, UX and tech-led business.
        <br><br>
        Our product and technology teams are a mix of new joiners and company veterans - a lot of the usual practices and processes still need establishing so it's definitely a good time to join and influence how things shape up in the future. Our current stack includes Go, React, GraphQL, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and MongoDB.
        <br><br>
        There's plenty of exciting things to happen here over the next 3-5 years; we have the plan and the budget to make it a good ride."

        "We’re building the best bank account in the world.
        <br><br>
        We believe there should be an alternative to the banking of the past: we're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.
        <br><br>
        We are obsessed with making our customers lives easier by giving them a simple realtime view of their finances, easy sending and spending, and complete control from their smartphone.

        <br><br>
        We're creating a bank with and for our customers, a bank that you'd be proud to be a part of.
        <br><br>
        Internally: we encourage an open, collaborative, inclusive working environment. Get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in, join open-door meetings, and all emails in the company are visible in an open archive.
        <br><br>
        We run hackathons, where people build things on our third party API, and we contribute to open source software. Our product roadmap is public, and we continually engage with our wonderful community.
        <br><br>
        We're hiring engineers and engineering managers to join our talented team."
