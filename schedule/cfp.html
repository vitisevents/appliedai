        <h3>What we're looking for</h3>
      <p>
          Applied AI is focused on education and discussion of machine learning and AI across the spectrum of programming languages. We aim to attract the best speakers, contributors, and educators from around the world in hopes of providing the community with the best resources on AI programming.
          <br><br>We are looking for speakers and instructors to give talks and hands-on classroom sessions. We are seeking talks covering mainstream, advanced, niche and even a small number of non-technical topics aimed at a multitude of skill levels.
          <br><br>Applied AI seeks to deliver ‘wow’ talks that are fresh and inspiring about cutting edge topics or new perspectives on common problems. The audience will be from all backgrounds varying in skill level from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so talks varying widely in topic and skill level are required. Most of all we want speakers who have a deep knowledge about the topics they are proposing and can’t wait to share that knowledge with a whole group of of eager listeners. Tell us what you’re most passionate about and why we should be passionate about it as well.

      </div>

        <h3>Selection Process</h3>
        <p>We receive on average 80+ papers for our conferences. Please select from the following options when submitting your call for papers: training (full day), keynote (30 mins), or breakout session (50 mins). We will be selecting speakers and topics following this 3 step process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using an anonymised list of all papers (contains talk title, abstract, and 'why you should choose this talk'), the organisers rate each talk from 1-5 to create a shortlist of around 30 abstracts</li>
            <li>Abstracts are then discussed and put in order of must have talks, with the top 10-20 papers being the focus</li>
            <li>Submissions are then de-anonymised and final selections are made based on the speaker's location/cost of travel and level of the talk.</li>
         </ol>

        <h3>Speaker's Package</h3>

       <h3>How to Submit</h3>

We'll need to know some bits and bobs about yourself and we'll need a title and abstract of the talk you'd like to give. We're also interested to know why you think we should choose your talk.
